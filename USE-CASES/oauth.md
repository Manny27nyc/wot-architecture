### Target Users

<List all stakeholders that are involved in the use case from the following list:
- device owners
- device user
- cloud provider
- service provider
- device manufacturer
- gateway manufacturer
- network operator (potentially transparent for WoT use cases)
- identity provider
- directory service operator>

### Motivation:

For each OAuth2 flow, we need to define a use case for which it is relevant.

### Expected Devices:

<List the target devices, e.g. as a sensor, solar panel, air conditioner>

### Expected Data:

<List the type of expected data, e.g. weather and climate data, medical conditions, machine sensors, vehicle data>

### Dependencies - Affected WoT deliverables and/or work items:

<List the affected WoT deliverables that have to be changed to enable this use case>

### Description:

<Provide a description from the users perspective>

#### Variants:

For each OAuth2 flow, there is a corresponding use case variant.
We also include the experimental "device" flow for consideration.

* code
* implicit
...
* device

### Security Considerations:

<Describe any issues related to security; if there are none, say "none" and justify>

### Privacy Considerations:

<Describe any issues related to privacy; if there are none, say "none" and justify>

### Gaps:

<Describe any gaps that are not addressed in the current WoT standards and building blocks>

### Existing standards:

<Provide links to relevant standards that are relevant for this use case>
